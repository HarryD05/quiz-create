# QuizCreate
Created for my A-level programming project, a website where teachers can create quizzes for their classes to complete online

## Features
### _For Teachers:_ ###
- Create classes (choosing the name, qualification, subject and joining code)
- Assign quizzes for classes to complete online, with no marking required
- Results for classes and specific students shown with graphs and tables, areas of concern highlighted
- All quesitons created (from all teachers) stored in database for reuse when creating quizzes (categorised by qualification, subject and topic)

### _For Students:_ ###
- Join classes using the joining code created by your teacher
- Complete quizzes which are marked instantaneously, on the results page an explanation for the correct answer will be given
- See your results visualised & topics of concern highlighted
